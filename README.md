# SC-IAT-in-JsPsych

An example of an SC-IAT in Js-Psych 5 based on other examples posted previously by Nathan Parkin in Google groups here: https://groups.google.com/g/jspsych/c/3-YrE1upPqM/m/qXE5OCLXAQAJ

The experiment posted here has several additions:

1. Instructions have been translated into English
2. The code checks for mobile devices, and only runs on computers. 
3. The code includes a box for participants to provide a subject ID, and provides participants with a random ID if they do not provide an ID of their own
4. The code includes a randomiser to push participants to different versions of the IAT. This can be used for counterbalancing presentation orders, or if in the example experiment, randomising the presentation order of two SC-IATs.
